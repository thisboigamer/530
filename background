My name is Michael DeAnda. I was born and reared in "Borderland City," El Paso, TX. I began
playing computer games at age two, when my sister brought home a floppy disk containing "Frogger."
We inserted the floppy into our Mac IIFX and began playing. I wasn't very good at the game
because I thought it was funny when the frog was run over by a car. My family introduced me
to board games early in my development. At home, we would play Monopoly or Sorry on a weekly basis,
and whenever we would go see my grandmother, we would play Black Jack and Rummy.

I enrolled in the Interactive Media and Game Development (IMGD) program at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (WPI) to study the design of video game art. During the my life as an
undergrad, I took a class about philosophy in video games. Inspired by the direction of
this class, I decided to pursue a second major in philosophy.

I am now a Ph.D. candidate at Illinois Institute of Technology.

My future goals are to:
