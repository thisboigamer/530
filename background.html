<header><h1> Michael DeAnda - This Boi Gamer </h1>
<h2>Background and Ambitions</h2></header>
<article>
<p>My name is Michael DeAnda. I was born and reared in "Borderland City," El Paso, TX. I began
playing computer games at age two, when my sister brought home a floppy disk containing "Frogger."
I wasn't very good at the game because I thought it was funny when the frog was run over by a car. My family introduced me
to board games early in my development. At home, we would play Monopoly or Sorry on a weekly basis,
and whenever we would go see my grandmother, we would play Black Jack and Rummy.
</p>
<h3>Deeper into the Pixels</h3>
<p>I enrolled in the Interactive Media and Game Development (IMGD) program at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (WPI) to study the design of video game art. During the my life as an
undergrad, I took a class about philosophy in video games. Inspired by the direction of
this class, I decided to pursue a second major in philosophy. I received a dual major bachelor's
degree in 2012 and returned in the fall to complete a fifth-year master degree in IMGD with a focus in games studies.
</p>
<h3>Ph.D.</h3>
<p>I am now a Ph.D. candidate at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Technical Communication. Here, I plan on
deepening my understanding of the computer games and challenging myself to observe the interaction of LGBTQ gamers in play spaces
and game production. I view this time as a great opportunity to strengthen my research methods, game design techniques and contribute
to the academic field of games studies.
</p>
<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p>My future goals are to:
<ul>
  <li>Design games that are inclusive of LGBTQ players</li>
  <li>Study the voices and stories of the LGBTQ gaming community and gamers in order to view their agency within spaces that are often set against them<li>
  <li>Network with other academics and designers to create projects that acknowledge and affirm LGBTQ gamers' presence</li>
</p>
<h3>Other Interests</h3>
<p>When I'm not studying or rigorously researching, I enjoy:
  <li>Long walks on the beach... JUST KIDDING!</li>
  <li>Playing games, I prefer table-top games over videogames. My favorite is Dominion!</li>
  <li>Watching movies! YAY NETFLIX!</li>
  <li>Drawing-it's both a creative outlet and a way for me to find inspiration for potential designs</li>
  <li>Visiting museums of all kinds: art, fashion, history, science. You never know where you will find inspiration.</li>
  <li>Dancing-I am a certified Zumba instructor</li>
